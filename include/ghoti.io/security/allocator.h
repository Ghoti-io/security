/**
 * @file allocator.h
 *
 * Allocator abstraction for the Ghoti.io Security library.
 *
 * This is cutil's `GCU_Allocator` under a local name. One definition
 * across the suite means an allocator written for any library works with all
 * of them. A `NULL` allocator argument means the default.
 *
 * Nothing this library returns to the caller is allocated with `malloc`
 * directly. Phase 0 does not allocate at all; the type is here so later
 * primitives do not grow a second allocator.
