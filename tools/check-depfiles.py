"""Fail if an object tree does not track its header dependencies.

Every tree that compiles `src/*.c` must pass `-MMD` and must have its `.d`
files read back with `-include`.  Both halves matter and the failure mode of
missing either is the same: a header changes, some objects rebuild and others
do not, and the archive ends up holding two versions of the same declaration.

That is not hypothetical.  The constant-time tree wrote `.d` files from the
day it was added and nothing ever included them.  On 2026-09-28 a field was
added to `GSEC_Limits`; `core.c` recompiled because `core.c` had changed,
`random.c` did not because `random.c` had not, and the two objects disagreed
about how big the struct was.  `gsec_limits_default` wrote past the caller's
local and the freshly enabled stack protector reported stack smashing inside
`gsec_random_bytes` - a report that read exactly like a buffer overflow in
the entropy call.  The fuzz tree had no `-MMD` at all.

A stale gate certifies nothing, and it does it quietly, which is why this is
a build-time check rather than a comment.

Usage: check-depfiles.py [Makefile]
