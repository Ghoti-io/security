"""Run one oracle gate, having first proved its reference is reachable.

    oracle_run.py <name>[,<name>...] -- <command> [args...]

The reference is resolved and asked its version before the gate runs, and
that line is printed above the gate's own output. With GHOTI_ORACLE_REQUIRED=1
an unreachable reference is an error. Without it the process still declines
to run, prints SKIPPED, and exits 0 — a decline, not a pass, and `make
check-oracle` sets the variable so a decline is a failure.
