"""How an oracle is spelled, so that no tool here spells one itself.

Copied from the font library's oracle_env.py, which is the built-here shape:
the image has no upstream digest, so check_pin() runs in both modes, and the
version the reference prints is the guarantee. What changed is the probe table
and one fail-closed addition: a probe that exits non-zero is a failure even
if its stdout happens to contain the expected text. A cryptography oracle that
accepts a crashed probe because the banner looked right is not a pin.

`command("openssl")` returns the argv prefix that runs the reference, which is
`docker run` into the image built by `containers/openssl/Containerfile`.

Modes, from GHOTI_ORACLE_MODE:

  container  (default) run the reference in its pinned image
  host                 run a binary of the same name on this machine, and
                       still require it to report the pinned version
